# CastingShadows
Jon-Joel Ocfemia

This is a virtualized version of my current favorite board game, "Casting Shadows" by Unstable Games.
As of now the game is incomplete. The following still needs to be implemented:


-startTurn() in CastingShadows.java stil needs to be completed:


turn.equals("Travel")- not started

turn.equals("Cast")- not started

turn.equals("Reroll") - in progress

turn.equals("Protect") - not started

turn.equals("Purchase") - not started


-main() in Cards.java needs additional <Cards> in ArrayList<Cards> gameDeck
    -ArrayList<Cards> gameDeck should have at least 50 <Cards> with different int range, damage, level, and String cardName
        -<Cards> should be as balanced as possible, over powered <Cards> should be avoided. 
        -<Cards> with high damage should have a high int buyCost.
